## ðŸ¤– About Tiwater

Tiwater is an engineering-driven organization focused on enabling robots with cutting-edge Embodied AI into practical, real-world solutions. We bridge the gap between academic breakthroughs and industrial applications, creating tangible value through robust implementation of human-robot interaction, motion generation, and imitation learning technologies.

## ðŸŒŸ Focus on HRI: Human-Robot Interaction

### ðŸ‘¥ Perception and Expression

1. **Multimodal Perception**:
    - Accommodate multiple input/output modes for better perception.
    - Scale with application complexity, using expression - based retargeting for feedback.
2. **Gesture Recognition**:
    - High - accuracy recognition in various settings, using perception retargeting for different user actions.
    - Optimized for seamless real - world integration to enhance expression understanding.
3. **Industry - Specific Interaction**:
    - Tailor to industry needs, focusing on perception of work - related gestures.
    - Meet safety/workflow standards with proper expression patterns.

### ðŸ“š Manipulation in the Physical World

1. **Movement Control**:
    - Generate precise/stable movements, using motion retargeting for different robots.
    - Consider physical limits for effective manipulation.
2. **Skill Transfer**:
    - Rapid skill transfer between scenarios with manipulation - focused retargeting.
    - Enable quick adaptation for physical world tasks.
3. **Behavior Cloning**:
    - Reproduce complex behaviors accurately with cloning retargeting.
    - Integrate into applications for physical manipulation tasks.
